# Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Dashboard

## MPI Overview

The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a comprehensive measure developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative
and the United Nations Development Programme to assess poverty beyond traditional income-based metrics. It evaluates poverty
across three key dimensions—health, education, and standard of living—using ten indicators. By aggregating these factors, the
MPI provides a nuanced understanding of poverty, enabling policymakers and researchers to identify not only who is poor but also how they
are poor. This approach allows for more targeted and effective poverty reduction strategies, as it highlights specific areas of deprivation within
communities, guiding resource allocation and policy formulation. The MPI's multidimensional perspective aligns closely with the complex
reality of poverty as experienced by individuals, recognizing that poverty encompasses more than just lack of income, but also
limited access to essential services and opportunities.
